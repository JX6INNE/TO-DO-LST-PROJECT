#TO DO LIST

The To-Do List application is a productivity tool designed to help users organize, prioritize, and track their daily tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, set priorities, and schedule deadlines to stay on top of their responsibilities. The app provides a user-friendly interface that categorizes tasks based on their status (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed) and offers features like reminders, due date notifications, and search functionality to easily locate tasks.
